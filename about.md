<p>This is Amit, a software developer by profession and curious by nature. As a seasoned professional with over 6 years in tech, my journey spans architecting scalable systems to delving into the intricate world of databases. Beyond the realm of code, I'm a cricket aficionado reveling in the elegance of the game. Movies, reading about Modern Indian history, and social media scroll takes up my other free time. </p>

<p>This space would be about the projects I do, tech and otherwise and tasks I undertake. Idea is to be held accountable to all the things I write here. Blogs, Goals pages would be coming up next.</p>
